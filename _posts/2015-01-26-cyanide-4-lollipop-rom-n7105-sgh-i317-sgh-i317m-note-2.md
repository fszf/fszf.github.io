<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cyanide V.4 Lollipop Note 2 Review</h2>
I recently <a href="http://frankshin.com/ditto-note-4-for-note-2-n7100-n7105-i317/">wrote about Ditto Note 4</a> and saying how AOSP roms were getting boring.  Well, I lied.  I've been trying Lollipop roms on the Note 2 since they arrived as alpha builds, meaning there were quite a few things not working. First off, let me say that I love lollipop.  I love it more than touchwiz.  I love it more than kit kat.

<strong>Netflix</strong>

There are a few things that doesn't work in lollipop but I'm sure they will be fixed soon.  Netflix doesn't work unless you use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sygsogo/downloads/detail?name=Netflix-1.8.1.apk">version 1.8.1</a> which is really old - but hey, it works!

<strong>Kernel</strong>

Also, I've been having some hiccups while using the provided Shift Kernel.  In the forums, I noticed people with SGH-I317m (canadian variant) had these hiccups.  I'm not sure how or why but I changed my bootloader from a 4.1.2 to NH2 (4.4.4) as well as using Agni Kernel instead of Shift.  So far, my experience has been golden.

<strong>Battery</strong>

Not only is the lollipop UI amazing but my phone's battery gave me 6+ hours of screen time.  That is monster battery life of active using.  Most roms with good battery life gave me the ball point of 5 hours of screen time.  Touchwiz gave me 4.5-5 hours just for reference.  What I noticed about this rom was that lollipop handles sleep very well.  If you don't use your phone, the battery hardly gets touched.  I think for a 6 hour period where I didn't touch my phone, the battery dropped down by 1%.

<strong>Xposed App</strong>

We won't see xposed anytime soon as it doesn't work on ART only roms, which lollipop is.  But I can live without !!

<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/devdb/project/?id=2506#downloads">Agni Kernel Link To XDA</a> For this rom, I've been using version 3.0.3 with very good results.
