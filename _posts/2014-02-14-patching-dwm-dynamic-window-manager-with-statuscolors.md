title: Patching DWM (Dynamic Window Manager) with statuscolors
layout: post
---
After you have <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dwm">DWM installed </a>and running, the first step in customizing DWM is to patch it.  Today we are going to look at adding in a patch that will enable colours in the statusbar.

Getting the patch:
<ol>
	<li>Go to the suckless <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/">website</a> to view the available patches.</li>
	<li>Under <em><strong>patches/</strong></em><strong>  </strong><strong></strong>you will see <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors">statuscolor</a></li>
	<li>At the bottom there is a link for <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dwm-5.9-statuscolors.diff">dwm-5.9-statuscolors.diff</a></li>
</ol>
Patching format:
<pre><code>cd dwm-directory
git apply path/to/patch.diff</code></pre>
Patching:
<pre>cd ~/dwm/src/dwm6.0 
patch -p1 &lt; ~/dwmpatch/dwm-5.9-statuscolors.diff</pre>

The lines that start with a minus (-) indicate which lines to remove.  The entire Hunk #1 failed because one or more lines weren't found.  This is most likely happening because the dwm version we have is 6.0 and this patch was diff'd against a 5.9 version (just my guess).  That means we need to edit the default config.def.h to match the (-) lines.

Snippet of default config.def.h:
<pre>static const char normbordercolor[] = "#444444";
static const char normbgcolor[] = "#222222";
static const char normfgcolor[] = "#bbbbbb";
static const char selbordercolor[] = "#005577";
static const char selbgcolor[] = "#005577";
static const char selfgcolor[] = "#eeeeee";</pre>
All we need to do is edit the values in the dwm-5.9-statuscolors.diff to match the default config.def.h so replace #cccccc with #444444 and so on and so forth.  Then save the patch as dwm-6.0-statuscolors.diff and then whenever you reinstall DWM and need to patch statuscolors, you can do so without all this hassle.

Keep in mind that some patches can't patch over a pre-patched source, so there is a general order of patches you must follow.  That will be covered at a later time.
