<p style="text-align: left;">It isn't a secret that I view my blog's read count every hour.  Ok I lied again, more like every 10 min.  From the looks of it there are quite themany people interested in my Note 2 posts.  Here's a todo list for upcoming posts hopefully this week:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Odin new firmware for bootloader and modem</li>
	<li>Odin recovery (twrp/philz cwm)</li>
	<li>Odin root</li>
	<li>Hosting all the files on top of providing link to originals for convenience (maybe)</li>
	<li>Cool apps</li>
</ul>
Let me know what you think in the comments.  What would you like to see more of?
