title: Switching to Jekyll on Github
---

Welcome reader!  

One of my first blogs I've published is with Wordpress at www.frankshin.com and it worked well at first.  There were some ... inefficiencies.  Wordpress is huge.  Maybe too huge/complex for what I need to run a simple blog.  

Over the past couple of years, more and more blogs were being converted to octopress/jekyll.  This piqued my interest.  Why was everyone in the tech community abandoning Wordpress?  Well, instead of reading blog posts on 'why' they left Wordpress, I figured it would be best to just dive right in to Jekyll.  And that's what I did.

A quick search led me to find [Jekyll Now](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

After forking the repo and setting it up in a couple minutes, I now have a live blog that utilizes github/jekyll/markdown combination.  Oh my~ how hackish of me~~
