<h3>I'm Pregnant (No! Not Me You Fool!)</h3>
That moment when your wife comes up to you smiling, you already know deep down inside what she is about to say -- I'm Pregnant!!! This is the moment in my life where everything becomes surreal.  No longer was I just a regular joe, eating Doritos and Coca Cola while browsing the web.  I am now a role model, a protector, a teacher ... a FATHER?!  Ahhh~  As my wife's belly grew and grew, I went through judgement day.  What kind of human do I want to be portrayed as?  What are my good characteristics?  What are bad hobbies of mine?  The list goes on and on.  No father in their right mind wants to be a bad father by choice.
<h3>The Cries Of The Baby</h3>
Olivia Shin was born Sept 29 2014 around 8pm.  I was overwhelmed.  I cried.  Yes, I admit that.  It was a beautiful moment to see your first child for the first time.  For the next two months, I took care of her from evening till morning.  She would sleep on my chest for awhile and sleep in her baby pod.  These moments were filled with cries and sobs but cherish them I will [Yoda Voice].

Doing graveyard and sleeping in the morning drives me a little crazy.  Perhaps I had sympathetic postnatal depression.  It's funny how those days seem far away but in reality that was just a couple months ago.  Olivia is sleeping well now without needing me and is slowly on her way to independence.
<h3>Her Smiles</h3>
The single greatest reward in parenting is having your baby look at you and giving you a big smile accompanied by laughter.  Olivia, thank you for noticing me.  Thank you for giving me your big smiles.
