title: Back in action! 
---

WOW!  Almost two years since my last post.  Since then I've left my career to chase my passion in technology.  I'll admit, it was a rough and scary transition to leave your comfort zone, equip your keyboard and mouse as your sword and shield to venture forth into the unknown.

The dust has settled and I have found time to emerse myself back into the open source world.  Yes, that means I'll be writing on this blog again.  Stay tuned...

PS.  I've had the fortunate encounter of finding a new technical blog theme called Thinkspace.
